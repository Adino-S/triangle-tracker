## About the moving triangle
The moving triangle is a simple game used to help children think through types of triangles. Targeting children, it uses the vertices of a triangle to determine it type; rather than area and other complicated aspects. We decided to make the page simple and fun, and opted for an image that was fun and engaging.

## Set Up Instruction
This games educates the playful user about three main types of triangles, and whether or not, what they have is just not a triangle! The user keys in the digits they have into the html form, and the results are printed.
- Isosceles triangle = two sides are exactly equal
- Equilateral triangle = all sides must be equal
- Scalane triangle = none of the sides is equal
- Not a triangle = if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side

# **TECHNOLOGIES USED**
## JavaScript
The game was developed using JavaScript operators, arithmetic operators, strings and arrays, to create a loop that asks the users to key in three series of numbers in determining the type of triangle. Control flows were used to direct the response provided to both the user, and on the console log.

# Bugs
None at the moment, but would love to hear your feedback!
