# **THE MOVING TRIANGLE**
### This is a fun game of identifying types of triangles.

#Created by **ADINO OLAGO**


#Types of Triangles it identifies
Educates the playful user about three main types of triangles, and whether or not, what they have is just not a triangle!
- Isosceles triangle
- Equilateral triangle
- Scalane triangle
- Not a triangle

#JavaScript
The game was developed using JavaScript operators, arithmetic operators, strings and arrays, to create a loop that asks the users to key in three series of numbers in determining the type of triangle. Control flows were used to direct the response provided to both the user, and on the console log.
