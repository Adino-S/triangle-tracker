## JavaScript
The game was developed using JavaScript operators, arithmetic operators, strings and arrays, to create a loop that asks the users to key in three series of numbers in determining the type of triangle. Control flows were used to direct the response provided to both the user, and on the console log.

## Bugs:
None at the moment, but would love to hear your feedback!
