# **THE MOVING TRIANGLE**
### This is a fun game of identifying types of triangles.

## About the moving triangle
The moving triangle is a simple game to determine types of triangles. It uses the vertices of a triangle to determine whether the input (numbers) relay a triangle or not; and if so, what type of triangle the type of triangle it is.

##Behaviour Driven Development
There are three main behaviour driven aspects to this webpage: page collects three sets of numbers from the user, carries out an analysis through user's click of the submit button, and results that are relayed through a prompt that indicates the answer in text.

- The page requests for three sets of numbers from the user to represent the 3 types of sides of a triangle
- Submit Button triggers the function to analyse the three sets of numbers, and calculate and determine whether triangle was Equilateral, Isoceles, Scalane, or Not a Traingle
-Reported the results to the user using an alert that informs the user of the

## Set Up Instruction


# **TECHNOLOGIES USED**
##HTML
The user keys in the digits they have into the html form, which has used three input boxes and a submit button to ensure that the user can key in three sets of numbers and submit for a result.

## JavaScript
The game was developed using JavaScript operators, arithmetic operators, strings and arrays, to create a loop that asks the users to key in three series of numbers in determining the type of triangle. Control flows were used to direct the response provided to both the user, and on the console log.

The results that are provided to the user are embedded in a function for triangles and reflect the following information:
- Isosceles triangle = two sides are exactly equal
- Equilateral triangle = all sides must be equal
- Scalane triangle = none of the sides is equal
- Not a triangle = if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side
